# Odd-Linked

Developing a simple app using ODD SDK. 

ODD SDK provides:
- User accounts using browser's Web Crypto API.
- Authorization using UCAN.
- Encrypted file storage using WNFS filesystem backed by IPLD.
- Key Management using AWAKE protocol to link devices.
- Platform APIs for publishing apps from the browser.

I will use these features to build a simple app that allows users to create a list of links. The links will be stored in the user's WNFS filesystem.
